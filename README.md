The KarabanBoard project is a task management application that allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks. Built with React.js, it utilizes functional components and hooks for efficient state management and UI rendering. The application employs CSS for styling and Tailwind CSS for a responsive and mobile-friendly layout. Task data is stored locally in the state, with input fields dynamically updated. The project also integrates @dnd-kit for advanced drag-and-drop functionality, enabling smooth reordering of tasks.
